Quiz ME

Description
For this project I took the starter codebase from Denver University of a fully functioning Tech Quiz application and enhanced it by adding Cypress for both component and end-to-end tests. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It allows users to take a quiz of ten random questions and view their final score.

I had to:
- Install Cypress as a dev dependency.
- Configure Cypress for both component and end-to-end testing.
- Create a component test for the quiz component.
- Create an end-to-test for the quiz component.

Features
- Componet resting with Cypress
- End to end testing with Cypress

Technologies Used
- MERN
- MongoDB
- Node.js/Express.js
- API
- CYPRESS
